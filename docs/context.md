# Welcome

The Request Finance API allows you to scale your web3 operations without the complexity of dealing with blockchains and smart contracts.&#x20;

With the API you can:

* Issue invoices and accept payments in cryptocurrency from your customers
* Track the status of your crypto invoices without polling blockchains
* Create salary payments to pay your employees in crypto

The backbone of the Request Finance API is the Request Network. The Request Network is a decentralized protocol built on Ethereum and maintained by the Request Foundation. For more information on how the two relate to each other, please visit [this page](faq.md#what-is-the-relation-between-the-request-finance-api-and-the-request-network).
